# netsum

`netsum` is an R package and Shiny web application designed to simplify network analysis of behavioral and psychological data.

## Features

-   **CSV file upload with automatic validation**\
    Ensures the input data is clean (e.g., no missing values) before proceeding with analysis.

-   **Interactive network visualization**\
    Allows users to select variables from the dataset to define network nodes.

-   **Customizable graph appearance**, including:

    -   Editable node labels
    -   Color-coding of node groups
    -   Custom network titles

-   **Centrality analysis** with multi-selection support:

    -   Strength
    -   Betweenness
    -   Closeness
    -   Expected Influence

-   **Auto-generated summary text**\
    Dynamically generates a written summary (mini results section) of key network results, populated from the analysis (e.g., top central nodes, robustness conclusions).

## Goals

The aim of `netsum` is to make network analysis more accessible, interpretable, and visually engaging without requiring extensive R coding skills.

## ðŸš€ Launch the Shiny App

The `netsum` package includes an interactive Shiny app for estimating and visualizing networks.

### ðŸ“¦ Installation

You can install `netsum` directly from GitHub or into an **renv** project:

``` r
# Install remotes if needed
install.packages("remotes")

# From GitHub
remotes::install_github("Programming-The-Next-Step-2025/shiny-networks")

# Or, in an renv-controlled project
renv::install("Programming-The-Next-Step-2025/shiny-networks")
```

After installation, launch the app using: `netsum::launch_netsum_app()`

This will open the interactive app in your default web browser.

## Quick Start

-Upload your CSV file.

-Select variables (and optionally a grouping variable).

-Choose an estimation method & tune parameters.

-Visualize your network with custom layouts/colors.

-Interpret centrality via table & auto-generated text.

-Export plots and tables for reports or publications.
